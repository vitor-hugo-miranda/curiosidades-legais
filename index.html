                <p>
                    -On October 7, 2023, the State of Israel suffers a terrorist attack by the Hamas group,killing more than 1000 israelis.In response, the armed forces of the jewish state responded with intense devastation of Palestinian territory with the help of American forces.This year,the Israeli secrets services organized a millitary operation to eliminate the leader of the Hamas and Hezbollah groups, with Hezbollah being one of the most powerful groups in the region.
                    The operation was successful, both leaders were executed by the Israeli military. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched a brutal attack against the country,but, before the full-force invasion, Israeli agents exchange the engines of Hezbollah military vehicles for bombs. When starting the vehicles, they all explode with members of Hezbollah inside, killing and maiming more than 5,000 members of the group. Now, Israel intends to divide the group, making it necessary to cross Lebanese borders, which is causing a global debate about this action with supporters and opponents.

            <h3>victim or villain?</h3>
             <p>
                -Saying that Israel or Hamas are either villains or victims is historically incorrect. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is incredibly deep. Letâ€™s break it down: religious differences, as both believe in different events; territory, since the region of Israel and Palestine is religiously sacred, and both believe that the land belongs to them. Additionally, no country in that region wants a nation that is a strong ally of the United States, believing that Israel serves as a gateway for U.S. influence in the area. The reason there is no peace in the Middle East is not due to the sharing of "sacred" land, but because no country in the Arab League wants the existence of a Jewish state. Some branches of Islam, like that of Iran, believe in the "purification" of the world, which they think requires the total elimination of Jews. This argument is supported by the fact that the Arab League violently rejected five peace proposals and ONU resolutions, leading to the deaths of numerous innocent people.
